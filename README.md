# Cards API

This small cards API was prepared as part of a recruitment process.
Of course, some corners were intentionally cut, as this is a quick demonstration project meant to showcase core skills rather than represent a fully production-ready solution.

## ðŸ”§ Libraries used
- xUnit + FluentAssertions + Moq (unit testing)
- CsvHelper (CSV data parsing)
- Swagger (API documentation)
- CorrelationId (Scope correlation Id)
- Automapper

## ðŸ§  Technical Decisions

### Error handling
I've implemented my own little ExecutionResult. Non of exisitng NuGet solutions ever met my standards and I've always end up creating my own. For full production environment I could improve it and put to separate NuGet package etc.
I generally avoid using exceptions to control application flow, as I believe it's better to reserve them for truly exceptional or unexpected situations. Using exceptions for regular logic paths can reduce code readability and performance.

### CSV Import
Based on exact business requirements I bet there is better way to store them, but for this small app purpose I thought this is good enough, as I have them easily readable/editable.
